# Peak-Finding-Problem
Solution for 1D and 2D Peak Finding Problem in C++

Solution contains: 1D array peak finding using brute force (O(n)), 1D array peak finding using binary search (O(log(n)), 2D array peak finding using brute force (O(n * m)) and 2D array peak finding using binary search (O(log(n * m)).

In 1D array {a,b,c}: b is a peak if b>=a and b >=c, a is a peak if a>=b, c is a peak if c>=b
In 2D array, an element is a peak if it >= all its neighbours.
